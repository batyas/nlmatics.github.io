# Speed up requests: Asyncio for Requests in Python

#### Don’t be like this.

As you have probably already noticed because you decided to visit this page, requests can take forever to run, so here's a nice blog written while I was an intern at NLMatics to show you how to use ```asyncio``` to speed them up.

## What is ```asyncio```?
It is a Python library that uses the ```async/await``` syntax to make code run asynchronously.
## What does it mean to run asynchronously?
### Synchronous (normal) vs. Asynchronous (using ```asyncio```)
- **Synchronous:** you must wait for the completion of the first task before starting another task.
- **Asynchronous:** you can start another task before the completion of the first task.

## Simple analogies
### Brick and Mortar

<img src="{{site.url}}/site_files/connie_post_images/brick-and-mortar.jpg" width="500" height="334">


Simon and Ash are building 5 walls of brick. 
- Simon builds one wall and waits for it to set before starting to build the next wall (synchronous). 
- Ash, on the other hand, starts building the next wall before the first one sets (asynchronous).  <br></br>
Ash starts the next task whereas Simon **waits**, so Ash (asynchronous) will finish faster.
The lack of ***waiting*** is the key to why asynchronous programming provides a performance boost.

A good coding use case would be when you have a lot of time-consuming requests lined up with the outputs independent of each other. request1 takes a while to finish running, so instead of waiting, you start request2, which doesn’t affect the output of request1.

### Laundry

<img src="{{site.url}}/site_files/connie_post_images/laundry.jpg" width="500">

Be wary that an asynchronous approach does not provide any performance boost when all the tasks are **dependent** on each other. For example, if you are washing and drying clothes, you must wait for the clothes to finish washing first before drying them no matter what, because drying clothes is dependent on the output of the washing. There is no use in using an asynchronous approach, because the pipeline is just the same as a synchronous approach.

The coding equivalent of this laundry example is when the output of request1 is used as the input in the request2.

## What syntax do I need to know?

| Syntax | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| async | Used to indicate which methods are going to be run asynchronously <br> <p>&#9; &#8594; These new methods are called **coroutines**. | <img src="{{site.url}}/site_files/connie_post_images/async.png" width="651"> |
| await | Used to run a coroutine once an asynchronous event loop has already started running <br> &#8594; <code>await</code> can only be used inside a coroutine <br> &#8594; Coroutines must be called with `await`, otherwise there will be a <code>RuntimeWarning</code> about enabling <code>tracemalloc</code>. <br></br> | <img src="{{site.url}}/site_files/connie_post_images/await.png" width="448"> |
| asyncio.run() | Used to start running an asynchronous event loop from a normal program <br> &#8594; `asyncio.run()` cannot be called in a nested fashion. You have to use await instead. <br> &#8594; `asyncio.run()` cannot be used if you are running the Python file in a Jupyter Notebook because Jupyter Notebook already has a running asynchronous event loop. You have to use await. (More on this in the Running the Code section)| <img src="{{site.url}}/site_files/connie_post_images/run.png" width="622"> |
| asyncio.create_task() | Used to schedule a coroutine execution <br> &#8594; Does not need to be awaited <br> &#8594; Allows you to line things up without actually running them first. | <img src="{{site.url}}/site_files/connie_post_images/create_task.png" width="822"> |
| asyncio.gather() | Used to run the scheduled executions <br> &#8594; Needs to be awaited <br> &#8594; This is vital to the asynchronous program, because you let it know which is the next task it can pick up before finishing the previous one. | ![]({{site.url}}/site_files/connie_post_images/gather.png) |

But with that, let’s jump straight into the code.

Follow along with the Python file and Jupyter Notebook in this [github repo](https://github.com/nlmatics/asyncio-for-requests) that I developed for this post!

## Code

### Preliminary

Get imports and generate the list of urls to get requests from. Here, I use [this placeholder url](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). Don’t forget to do ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in the terminal for all the modules that you don’t have. Normal `requests` cannot be awaited, so you will need to ```import requests_async``` to run the asynchronous code.

```Python
import requests, requests_async, asyncio, time

itr = 200
tag = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/'
urls = []
for i in range(1, itr):
    urls.append(tag + str(i))
```

### Synchronous

This is what some typical Python code for requests would look like.
```Python
def synchronous(urls):
    for url in urls:
        r = requests.get(url)
        print(r.json())
```

### Asynchronous

#### Incorrect Alteration 
The following is an understandable but bad alteration to the synchronous code. The runtime for this is the same as the runtime for the synchronous method, because you have not created a list of tasks that the program knows it needs to execute together, thus you essentially still have synchronous code.
```Python
async def asynchronous_fail(urls):
    for url in urls:
        r = await requests_async.get(url)
        print(r.json())
```

#### Correct Alteration
Create a list of tasks, and run all of them together using ```asyncio.gather()```. 
```Python
async def asynchronous(urls):
    tasks = []
    for url in urls:
        task = asyncio.create_task(requests_async.get(url))
        tasks.append(task)
    responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    for response in responses:
        print(response.json())
```

## Running the Code

### Python
Simply add these three lines to the bottom of your Python file and run it.
```python
starttime = time.time()
asyncio.run(asynchronous(urls))
print(time.time() - starttime)
```

If you try to run this same code in Jupyter Notebook, you will get this error:

```sh
RuntimeError: asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop
```

This happens because Jupyter is already running an event loop. More info [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55409641/asyncio-run-cannot-be-called-from-a-running-event-loop). You need to use the following:

### Jupyter Notebook
```python
starttime = time.time()
await asynchronous(urls)
print(time.time() - starttime)
```

## Ordering

Asynchronous running can cause your responses to be out of order. If this is an issue, create your own responses list and fill it up, rather than receiving the output from `asyncio.gather()`.
```Python
async def asynchronous_ordered(urls):
    responses = [None] * len(urls) # create own responses list
    tasks = []
    for i in range(len(urls)):
        url = urls[i]
        task = asyncio.create_task(fetch(url, responses, i))
        tasks.append(task)
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks) # responses is not set to equal this
    for response in responses:
        print(response.json())

async def fetch(url, responses, i):
    response = await requests.get(url)
    responses[i] = response # fill up responses list
```

## Batching

Sometimes running too many requests concurrently can cause timeout errors in your resource. This is when you need to create tasks in batches and gather them separately to avoid the issue. Find the ``batch_size`` that best fits your code by experimenting with a smaller portion of requests. Requests that take longer to process (long server delay) are more likely to cause errors than others. In my own experience with NLMatic’s engine, MongoDB had timeout errors whenever I ran batches of size greater than 10.

```python
async def asynchronous_ordered_batched(urls, batch_size=10):
    responses = [None] * len(urls)
    kiterations = int(len(urls) / batch_size) + 1
    for k in range(0, kiterations):
        tasks = []
        m = min((k + 1) * batch_size, len(urls))
        for i in range(k * batch_size, m):
            url = urls[i]
            task = asyncio.create_task(fetch(url, responses, i))
            tasks.append(task)
        await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    for response in responses:
        print(response.json())
```

## Runtime Results

|<img src="{{site.url}}/site_files/connie_post_images/table.png" width="500">|<img src="{{site.url}}/site_files/connie_post_images/chart.png" width="500">|
|---|---|

`synchronous` and `asynchronous_fail` have similar runtimes because the `asynchronous_fail` method was not implemented correctly and is in reality synchronous code.
`asynchronous`, `asynchronous_ordered`, and `asynchronous_ordered_batched` have noticeably better runtimes in comparison to `synchronous` - up to 4 times as fast.

In general, `asynchronous_ordered_batched` gives fast and stable code, so use that if you are going for consistency. However, the runtimes of `asynchronous` and `asynchronous_ordered` can sometimes be better than `asynchronous_ordered_batched`, depending on your database and servers. So, I recommend using `asynchronous` first and then adding extra things (order and batch) as necessary.

## Summary

As you have seen, `asyncio` is a helpful tool that can greatly boost your runtime if you are running a lot of independent API requests. It’s also very easy to implement when compared to threading, so definitely try it out. Of course, make sure that your requests are independent.

Now I must conclude by saying that using asyncio improperly implemented can cause many bugs, so sometimes it is not worth the hassle. If you really must, use my guide and use it  s p a r i n g l y.

And that's a wrap!
