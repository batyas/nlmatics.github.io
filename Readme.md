# NLMatics blog!




## I just wrote a blog post! What next?

Great! Write your blogpost in markdown, place the images in a separate folder.
Place the markdown file and the images folder in the 
  
  docs/_posts/ folder under your name. 

Remember to use the title tag so that the post shows up as a blog post.



We are using Jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate a static site from the blog posts. Check out the documentation of the directory structure here (https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/)
